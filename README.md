## Project Overview
BAZAARA is an app created with the intent of saving people money while shopping for groceries. BAZAARA is a progressive web application that enables store price aggregation especially for groceries as well as featuring live price updating. Users will be able to visit and use BAZAARA on both PC and mobile devices to allow flexible usage. Each user will have their own personal account that they can log into. Once logged in, the user can search for the prices of items individually or in bulk via the ‘grocery list’ feature which saves their selections for future use. The app will let the user know about current prices, trends, and future expectations for the cost of goods. It supports user price reporting via a built-in barcode scanner and photo analysis to enable aggregation of local pricing data.
